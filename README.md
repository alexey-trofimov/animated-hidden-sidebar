## Animated Hidden Sidebar

This is a simple and minimal hidden sidebar with animation when opened. Also this sidebar is fully responsive and looks good on mobile devices. The sidebar is great for displaying menus, widgets, or other additional content on your site. A live preview **demo** of the sidebar is available here: [Animated Hidden Sidebar - Demo](https://demo.minimalweb.site/animated-hidden-sidebar/). Demonstration in **Cyrillic** (Russian language): [Cyrillic Demo](https://demo.minimalweb.site/animated-hidden-sidebar/russian-language.html).

### Some notes:

*The project uses the following colors*:

- Body bg: #ffffff
- Content 1: #2a2b35
- Content 2: #474856
- Hover color: #757bda
- Gray colors: #f5f5f9 / #f3f3f6

*Image sizes*:

- Original: 750x500px
- **Recommended size: 1500x1000px**

*Google fonts*:

- Merriweather: serif; Weights: 400, 400 italic, 700, 700 italic. Link: [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather)
- Montserrat: sans-serif; Weights: 600, 600 italic, 700, 700 italic. Link: [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)

I also use the "**mw-**" prefix for CSS classes and IDs. This should make it easier to add this sidebar to your project, as using the extra prefix reduces the chance of conflicts with your project's code.
